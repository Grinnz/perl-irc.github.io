		<h1>Standards Of Conduct</h1>

		<h2>Network Access</h2>

		<p>You will be scanned via an automated process to check for various disallowed
		and insecure services. <b>The only way to opt-out of these scans is to not join
		the network.</b></p>

		<p>We participate in several blackhole lists with other IRC networks. If
		you have caused problems on other networks, there's a good chance our bots
		won't even let you on the network. We do not have the ability to remove you
		from these lists. </p>

		<p>irc.perl.org <i>does not and will not</i> host network wide
		"services" like some other networks do, notably freenode. It is
		expected that each channel will take the necessary steps to ensure that
		someone has ops and that channel policy is enforced.</p>

		<p>Usage of this network is a privilege, not a right. Your access can be
		revoked at any time for any reason. The reason doesn't have to make sense to
		you and it doesn't have to be fair. General policies, however, are listed
		below.</p>

		<h2>Security And Liability</h2>

		<p>irc.perl.org attempts to run a safe and secure network. However, the security
		bots cannot catch everyone with ill intent and we cannot guarantee the security
		of a user's IRC client. We will respond with haste and rage to any reported
		security related incident. That said, <b>irc.perl.org is not responsible or
		liable for the security or lack thereof surrounding your time on the
		network.</b></p>

		<p><u>Snowden Disclosures:</u> Due to the IRC server software we use, all
		channel traffic is propagated to all server nodes. The links between servers
		are encrypted, however, using cryptlink. You can prevent traffic from
		propagating by using a server-local channel. These are created using '&amp;'
		instead of '#'. All users will need to connect to the same server IP. </p>

		<p>We have never received any requests for user information and would
		probably wet ourselves laughing if we did.</p>

		<h2>Bot Policy</h2>

		<p>irc.perl.org tolerates all bot software with 2 major exceptions. The
		bots cannot: 1) disrupt the network. 2) disrupt channel activity. It is
		up to the discretion of the staff and channel ops to determine what
		constitutes "disruption". If you are asked to remove your bot from the
		network, it is expected you will act promptly with minimal fuss.
		Failure to do so may cause a revocation of your access to the network.


		<h2>Personal Conduct</h2>

		<h3>Network Policies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Do</b>: obey the opers. See below for more.</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: engage in spamming</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: engage in flooding</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: evade ban or ignores</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: threaten another user or users with physical or
			network violence (including DDoS)</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: log channel activity without the channel's
			express and on-the-record (preferably via /topic) consent</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: attempt to host a botnet here.</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>We absolutely will not tolerate child pornography or any content
			that endangers minors.</b> (Yes, this includes PHP.)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We will engage local authorities as necessary to deal with illegal
		content and activities. Yes, we have done this before.</p>

		<h3>Community Policies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="reasonable_person.html">Reasonable person principle
			applies.</a></li>
			<li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
			<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and
			speech.</li>
			<li>Alert the staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone
			in distress.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
		discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct.</p>

		<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive comments
		related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
		inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; deliberate
		intimidation, stalking or following; sustained disruption of channel
		activity; unwelcome sexual attention; ignore and/or ban evasion.</p>

		<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
		immediately.</p>

		<p>If anyone engages in unacceptable behavior, the opers may take any
		action they deem appropriate including kickbans (permanent and/or
		temporary), network connection termination (/kill), network-wide ban
		(gline/kline)</p>

		<h3>Channels Specific Policies</h3>

		<p>Where they do not collide with network policy, individual channels
		can set their own standard of conduct. These policies must be made
		visible in such a way that new users  are made immediately aware of
		them when they join the channel. We suggest using the channel
		topic.</p>

		<p>Logging and publishing of channel content for channels that are mode +s, +k, or +i
		is disallowed by network policy, channel maintainers can override this rule.
		</p>

		<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

		<p>If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else
		is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
		please notify your favorite oper. If you do not have a favorite oper,
		please contact sungo, mst and/or perigrin.</p>

		<h2>Staff</h2>

		<p>Opers are the network staff. On some networks, opers are limited to
		network policy maintenance and leave channel issues alone. irc.perl.org
		takes a different approach. Our opers are immune to all network and
		channel restrictions. They cannot be banned and channel keys do not
		affect them. They can perform operations on channels without being +o.
		They can terminate your connection and ban you from channels and the
		network.</p>

		<p><i>tl;dr</i>: irc.perl.org opers are essentially the local gods.</p>

		<p><b>Opers are free to create policy on a whim as dictated by the needs of the
		situation. They are not bound to Reasonable Person Principle.</b> We do not
		grant oper status without careful consideration of the individual and their
		contributions to the community and network. They are here for your benefit.</p>

		<h3>The Opers</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>hachi</li>
			<li>mst</li>
			<li>perigrin</li>
			<li>rjbs</li>
			<li>sungo</li>
			<li>Yaakov</li>
		</ul>
