		<h1>irc.perl.org - Channels</h1>

		<h2>Not-So Official Channels</h2>
		The following channels are either not associated with a specific project or are not the official home of anyone except perhaps the miscreants that inhabit them. They did, however, ask to be listed here. Who are we to refuse them?

		<ul>
			<li>#perl - #perl is a hangout for members of the Perl community. It is not representative of the perl community as a whole, nor is it the only place that the Perl community calls home. Topics range from Perl, perl internals, c, random philosophy, LOST, hatred of our jobs, etc. Most anything goes. That said, this is not the place to ask newbie perl questions. More advanced questions may be entertained but perl newbies are better served elsewhere. See <a href="faq.html">the FAQ</a> for some suggested destinations. As noted in the FAQ, #perl can be a rough place and isn't recommended for people prone to stress related breakdowns, the Amish, or anyone who owns a Chevy Impala. - See also <a href="http://pound.perl.org">pound.perl.org</a></li>
