		<h1>irc.perl.org: FAQ</h1>

		<h2>What is irc.perl.org</h2>
			<p>irc.perl.org is collection of IRC servers run by
				various members of the Perl community. The URI of irc.perl.org is a DNS
				round-robin which points to these servers. This network also goes by the
				names of MagNET and Rhizomatic.</p>


		<h2>So what's MagNET?</h2>
			<p>MagNET is an IRC network that was started by users of
				Efnet #perl some time ago. People use it for all sorts now, but it's mostly
				populated by people related to the Perl community in some way or another.</p>

		<h2>Is MagNET the official Perl network?</h2> 
			<p>That's a hard question to answer. MagNET did not start life
				as the official Perl network. A while back, irc.perl.org got pointed here
				and we took on the mantle, however reluctantly, of the semi-official Perl
				network. Many Perl projects call this network home. Many do not. That is
				their choice. We welcome any projects or groups, perl related or not, who
				would like a safe place to call home.</p>

		<h2>Does that mean #perl is the official Perl channel?</h2>
			<p>#perl is certainly not the official Perl channel. The
				history of #perl is long and sordid but one truth remains: #perl is
				primarily a social channel for members of the Perl community. Advanced
				questions will often be answered but newbie-type questions are best asked
				in other channels. Be advised that #perl can be a rough place and is not
				recommended for minors, pregnant women, or those with heart
				conditions.</p>

		<h2>Where can I get Perl help?</h2>
			<p>#perl-help, #perl on irc.freenode.net, #perl on
				irc.oftc.net</p>

		<h2>What other channels are available?</h2>
			<p>MagNET is home to hundreds of individual IRC channels.
				While it would be impossible to list and describe them all, we do maintain
				a <a href="channels.html">list of the more popular and potentially
				"official" channels</a> who make their home here.</p>

		<h2>Where is Nickserv/Chanserv?</h2>
			<p>MagNET is a services-free network. We do not run any
				channel protection or nick/handle protection services. If you have
				abuse/security concerns, please contact the nearest oper.</p>

		<h2>Why isn't this site shiny and full of pretty pictures and styling?</h2>
			<p>You are aware that you're reading a site for an irc network,
			right? An ancient chat system that is neither shiny nor full of
			pretty? It's text; it's all just text. This site is compatible with
			RFC 1866 + 1942 (circa 1996). As such, the site works well in the
			vast majority of browsers, including lynx, elinks, and firefox. I
			don't have it on hand to test but I bet the site looks great in ncsa
			mosaic too. (And no, I will not accept CSS patches to make this
			"pretty". Install the Stylish plugin for Firefox)</p> </body>
