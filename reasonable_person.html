		<h1>Reasonable Person Principle</h1>

		<p>Reasonable Person Principle is <i>the</i> rule which you must abide by when accessing this network. Put differently, following the Principle is your obligation to your fellow community members.</p>

		<p>The Principle was borrowed from Carnegie Mellon University, who use it as the governing principle for access to their computer systems; since it works for a whole University, we hope it will work for an IRC network with a few thousand participants. So far, results have been positive.</p>

		<p>From Carnegie Mellon University's own explanation of the Principle:
			<ul>
				<li>Everyone will be reasonable.</li>
				<li>Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.</li>
				<li>No one is special.</li>
				<li>Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Reasonable people think about their use of these facilities, and the needs of others, and adjust their behavior to meet the goals of a common good for the community, i.e., expressing what you want to say, but accepting and accommodating the needs of others.</p>
